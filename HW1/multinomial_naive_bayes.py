            # prior[0] is the prior probability of a document being of class 0
            # likelihood[4, 0] is the likelihood of the fifth(*) feature being 
            # active, given that the document is of class 0
            # (*) recall that Python starts indices at 0, so an index of 4 
            # corresponds to the fifth feature!
